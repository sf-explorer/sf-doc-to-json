Note Since service resources can represent crews or individuals, appointments are typically assigned to crews in the following way: Create a service resource of the Crew type that represent the crew. Create an assigned resource on the service appointment and select the crew resource in the ServiceResourceId field. As an alternative, you can assign appointments to crew members separately. This lets you track each member’s travel time and see a list of the crew members in the Assigned Resources related list. To take this approach, create an assigned resource for each crew member. List the crew member in the ServiceResourceId field and the crew they belong to in the ServiceCrewId field."
