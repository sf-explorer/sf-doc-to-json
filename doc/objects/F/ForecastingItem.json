Depending on whether your organization uses individual forecast category rollups or cumulative forecast rollups, you have these possible values for the ForecastingItemCategory field. Individual forecast category rollups: PipelineOnly - Rollup from Pipeline opportunities only. BestCaseOnly - Rollup from Best Case opportunities only. Adjustable. MostLikelyOnly - Rollup from Most Likely opportunities only. Adjustable. CommitOnly - Rollup from Commit opportunities only. Adjustable. Cumulative forecast rollups: OpenPipeline - Rollup from Pipeline + Best Case + Most Likely + Commit opportunities. BestCaseForecast - Rollup from Best Case + Most Likely + Commit + Closed opportunities. Adjustable. MostLikelyForecast - Rollup from Most Likely + Commit + Closed opportunities. Adjustable. CommitForecast - Rollup from Commit + Closed opportunities. Adjustable. Either cumulative or individual forecast category rollups: ClosedOnly - Rollup from Closed opportunities only. The ForecastingItemCategory field differs from the ForecastCategoryName field. The ForecastCategoryName field represents the forecast category of the underlying opportunities rolling up to forecast amounts. In organizations using cumulative forecast rollups, the ForecastCategoryName field can be null because the cumulative forecast amounts include opportunities from multiple forecast categories. The new ForecastingItemCategory field represents the type of rollup a forecast amount or adjustment is from. In organizations using individual forecast category columns, it contains the individual forecast rollup categories. In organizations using cumulative forecast rollups, it contains the cumulative rollup categories."
