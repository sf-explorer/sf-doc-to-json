ActivityEvent—indirectly generated event when a user or the API adds a Task associated with a feed-enabled parent record (excluding email tasks on cases). Also occurs when a user or the API adds or updates a Task or Event associated with a case record (excluding email and call logging). For a recurring Task with CaseFeed disabled, one event is generated for the series only. For a recurring Task with CaseFeed enabled, events are generated for the series and each occurrence. AdvancedTextPost—created when a user posts a group announcement and, in Lightning Experience as of API version 39.0 and later, when a user shares a post. AnnouncementPost—Not used. ApprovalPost—generated when a user submits an approval. BasicTemplateFeedItem—Not used. CanvasPost—a post made by a canvas app posted on a feed. CollaborationGroupCreated—generated when a user creates a public group. CollaborationGroupUnarchived—Not used. ContentPost—a post with an attached file. CreatedRecordEvent—generated when a user creates a record from the publisher. DashboardComponentAlert—generated when a dashboard metric or gauge exceeds a user-defined threshold. DashboardComponentSnapshot—created when a user posts a dashboard snapshot on a feed. LinkPost—a post with an attached URL. PollPost—a poll posted on a feed. ProfileSkillPost—generated when a skill is added to a user’s Chatter profile. QuestionPost—generated when a user posts a question. ReplyPost—generated when Chatter Answers posts a reply. RypplePost—generated when a user creates a Thanks badge in WDC. TextPost—a direct text entry on a feed. TrackedChange—a change or group of changes to a tracked field. UserStatus—automatically generated when a user adds a post. Deprecated. The following values appear in the Type picklist for all feed objects but apply only to CaseFeed: AttachArticleEvent—generated event when a user attaches an article to a case. CallLogPost—generated event when a user logs a call for a case through the user interface. CTI calls also generate this event. CaseCommentPost—generated event when a user adds a case comment for a case object. ChangeStatusPost—generated event when a user changes the status of a case. ChatTranscriptPost—generated event when Chat transcript is saved to a case. EmailMessageEvent—generated event when an email related to a case object is sent or received.
