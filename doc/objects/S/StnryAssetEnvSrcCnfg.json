It must begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. This field is automatically generated, but you can supply your own value if you create the record using the API. Note When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance may be slow while Salesforce generates one for each record."
