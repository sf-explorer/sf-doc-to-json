PreferredVerify: If the remote server supports TLS, Salesforce upgrades the current SMTP session to use TLS. Before the session begins, Salesforce verifies that the certificate is signed by a valid certificate authority, and that the common name presented in the certificate matches the domain or mail exchange of the current connection. If TLS is available but the certificate is not signed or the common name does not match, Salesforce disconnects the session and does not deliver the email. If TLS is unavailable, Salesforce continues the session without TLS. RequiredVerify: Salesforce continues the session only if the remote server supports TLS, the certificate is signed by a valid certificate authority, and the common name presented in the certificate matches the domain or mail exchange to which Salesforce is connected. If any of these criteria are not met, Salesforce terminates the session without delivering the email."
