With this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes are reflected in a subscriber’s organization. Label is Record Type Name.

In Developer Edition orgs, NamespacePrefix is set to the namespace prefix of the org for all objects that support it, unless an object is in an installed managed package. In that case, the object has the namespace prefix of the installed managed package. This field’s value is the namespace prefix of the Developer Edition org of the package developer.
