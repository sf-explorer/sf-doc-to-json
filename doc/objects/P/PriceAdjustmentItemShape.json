A Priority of 1 indicates this price adjustment item is applied first.Price adjustments with a null priority are applied after price adjustments with a specified priority. If two or more price adjustments have a null priority, percentage adjustments are applied before amount adjustments. Applying a percentage adjustment before an amount adjustment results in a larger total adjustment. Note The value of Priority must be unique among price adjustment items related to the same price adjustment group. For example, you can’t have two price adjustment items with a priority of 1. For example, let’s say that two price adjustment items apply to the same item to be priced. The first price adjustment, Spring_Promotion, defines a 10% discount and has Priority of 1. The second price adjustment, Early_Renewal_Discount, defines a $2,000 discount and has a Priority of 2. In this case, the Spring_Promotion price adjustment is applied before the Early_Renewal_Discount price adjustment."

This configuration indicates a $10 per-unit discount. If the subscription is priced for 12 months and the pricing term is 1, the PricingTermCount on the sales transaction item is 12. If the quantity is 5, the value of TotalAmount is 5 x 12 x -10 = -600"
