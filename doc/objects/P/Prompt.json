It must begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. In managed packages, this field prevents naming conflicts on package installations. With this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes are reflected in a subscriber’s organization. Note When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance slows down while Salesforce generates one for each record."

In Developer Edition orgs, NamespacePrefix is set to the namespace prefix of the org for all objects that support it, unless an object is in an installed managed package. In that case, the object has the namespace prefix of the installed managed package. This field’s value is the namespace prefix of the Developer Edition org of the package developer. In orgs that aren't Developer Edition orgs, NamespacePrefix is set only for objects that are part of an installed managed package. All other objects have no namespace prefix."
