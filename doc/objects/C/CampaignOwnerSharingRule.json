With this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes are reflected in a subscriber’s organization. Corresponds to Rule Name in the user interface. This field is available in API version 24.0 and later. Note When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance may slow while Salesforce generates one for each record."
