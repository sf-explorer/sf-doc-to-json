We recommend limiting the retries to fewer than nine times to avoid reaching this state.

Also, you can resume a trigger subscription in the subscription detail page that you access from the platform event page. Repartitioning—The system is in the process of modifying the trigger's parallel subscription configuration. Running—The subscriber is actively listening to events. If you modify the subscriber, the subscription continues to process events. Suspended—The subscriber is disconnected and can’t receive events because a Salesforce admin suspended it or due to an internal error. You can resume a trigger subscription in the subscription detail page that you access from the platform event page. To resume a process, deactivate it and then reactivate it.
