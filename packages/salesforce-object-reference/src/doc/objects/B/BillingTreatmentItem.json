Advance billing invoices a product or service before its delivery, whereas arrears billing invoices it after delivery. The billing system assesses the billing type to determine the next billing date for an order product. Valid values are: Advance—If the order item is billed in advance, the order’s billing day of month is evaluated to choose the nearest date on or before the order product’s start date. For example, if a monthly order product’s start date is January 1, and the order’s billing day of month is 15, the next billing date is December 15. Arrears—If the order item is billed in arrears, the order’s billing day of month is evaluated to choose the nearest date after the order product’s start date. For example, if a monthly order product’s start date is January 1, and the order’s billing day of month is 15, the order product’s next billing date is January 15. None"
