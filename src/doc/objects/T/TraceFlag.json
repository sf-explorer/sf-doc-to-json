Use this scope for class-level filtering. If there are both user and entity-level flags, the user flags take precedence until a method from a class with an entity trace flag is entered. When the method returns, the user trace flags are restored. When the value is emptyid, the user’s actions are traced to the org’s debug log at the described level. Debug logs are visible to all administrators. This option is only available if TracedEntityID references a user (not an Apex class or Apex trigger). The variable emptyid can be the value 0000000000000000 or null. The scope defined here is reflected in the ApexLog Location field."
