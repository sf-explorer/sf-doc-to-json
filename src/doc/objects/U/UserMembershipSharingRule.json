It must begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. In managed packages, this field prevents naming conflicts on package installations. With this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes are reflected in a subscriber’s organization. Corresponds to Rule Name in the user interface. Note When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance slows down while Salesforce generates one for each record."
